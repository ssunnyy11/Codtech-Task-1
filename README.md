Project Name: LED Blinking using Arduino

Objective: To make an LED blink at a specific interval using an Arduino board.

Components Needed:
1.Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)

2.LED (Light Emitting Diode)

3.Resistor (220Ω or 330Ω to limit current to the LED)

4.Breadboard (optional, for easy connections)

5.Jumper Wires (to connect components)

Circuit Diagram:
1.Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 13).
2.Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to a 220Ω resistor.
3.Connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) pin of the Arduino.

Steps:
1.Connect the Components: o Assemble the circuit as described above using the breadboard and jumper wires. o Ensure connections are secure and components are oriented correctly.
2.Write the Code: o Open the Arduino IDE on your computer. o Write a simple program to blink the LED.
3.Upload the Code: o Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable. o Select the correct port and board in the Arduino IDE. o Click the Upload button to transfer the program to the Arduino.
4.Test the Circuit: o Once the code is uploaded, the LED should start blinking with a 1-second ON and OFF interval.

Key Activities:
1.Designing and assembling the circuit on a breadboard.
2.Writing the LED blinking program in the Arduino IDE.
3.Uploading the program to the Arduino board using a USB connection.
4.Testing and debugging the circuit to ensure the LED blinks as intended.
5.Observing the output and verifying the functionality of the code and hardware.
